# Timeboxing Frontend/Backend in Django w/ API

This is a old project, the first web app I ever did, and therefore also not updated or up-to standard, just uploaded it here to keep it somewhere :)


## Timeboxing Frontend/Backend in Django w/ API

This project was a timeboxing service, where users could do timeboxing, and then the timeboxing session would be saved and statestics could be viewed in a time journal.
It also had the ability to choose what product and category of work you were working on during the timeboxing session.
